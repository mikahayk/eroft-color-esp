## Electronic Rituals, Oracles and Fortune Telling

Meditation 4
Assignment: Create a psychic “experiment” with your interpretation of an electronic equivalent of Zener Cards. Document your methodology and your results. (What is it possible to be “psychic” about in a digital context?)

Implementation: This project is my interpretation of extrasensory perception séance using color cards and sound. There are 20 prerecorded tones, where each tone is assigned to a particular color. A user is supposed to sense the sound and guess which tone represents the correct color card.
